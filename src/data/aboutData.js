    description2: "I’m excited to be in my final year at the Informatics Institute of Technology, mastering iOS development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. It’s been an invaluable experience and I’m grateful for the knowledge and skills I’ve gained. I am currently working on a final-year project which involves building an image captioning system. The system uses feature extraction and detection methods on images, tokenization, and caption generation using NLP. Besides coding, I am also involved in athletics and basketball as extracurricular activities. I also enjoy reading books whenever I get the chance. ",
